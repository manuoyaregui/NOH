# Custom Rules

Rules that are specific for this project. Specific practices that MUST be kept in mind when developing.

## Rendering

The game is ment to be in a style like the game "Forgive Father" where it's like a 2.5D (A world in 3d, but most entities are sprites looking at the camera), but it is in a 3rd person perspective.

## Language

- Always keep in mind a system for language. The game at minimum MUST be in ENGLISH and/or SPANISH.
- Make every wording config in a .csv file. Mantaining a key and a value for every language.
- Make it flexible, in case we wanna add more languages in the future.

## Coding

- Avoid making files longer than 500 lines of code. In that case, apply refactor, modularize, make reusable methods and implement a utils folder if necessary.
- Always use SOLID principles.
- Always fix Linter errors, avoid disabling linter.
- Always fix syntax errors and warning appearing in the code editor.
- Always code leaving blank lines in order to improve readability.

## GDD

- NEVER modify this file, except it's explicitly asked that.

## External Assets

- Always look for assets in the godot assetStore that can facilitate the developing task. NEVEr implement without asking the user for permission. In that case, explain detailing why it's a good asset to implement.
